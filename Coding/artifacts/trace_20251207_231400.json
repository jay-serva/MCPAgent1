      "audit_trail": "Audit Statement:\n\nThe provided context lacks clarity regarding employee trading policies, particularly for employees wishing to engage in stock market activities. There is an absence of explicit guidelines addressing whether employees are permitted to trade in the stock market, leading to ambiguity. The references to privacy regulations and consumer financial information do not directly relate to employee trading, which creates a disconnect in the policy framework.\n\nMoreover, the context contains contradictions, as it discusses privacy regulations without establishing how these regulations impact employee trading activities. The mention of various regulatory bodies and their privacy regulations does not clarify the specific obligations or restrictions applicable to employees trading in securities.\n\nAdditionally, the policy is incomplete, as it fails to outline the necessary procedures or approvals required for employees to engage in stock trading. Without clear directives, employees may inadvertently violate compliance standards, exposing the institution to potential regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIn summary, the current policy lacks specificity regarding employee trading permissions, contains contradictory elements concerning privacy regulations, and is incomplete in addressing the necessary compliance measures for employees wishing to trade in the stock market. Immediate revisions are recommended to ensure clarity and compliance.",
